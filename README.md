# PurdueCAC-Website
This is the code that powers the PurdueCAC.org website. I hand coded this using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. The images were edited in Photoshop CC 2015. Please note that this site uses CouchCMS for dynamic editing; I have not included those files in this repository. Those reside in an /execadmin folder on the server.
